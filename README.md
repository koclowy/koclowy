## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a Computer Science student from Malaysia specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Currently learning Python, and I also enjoy designing UI and UX that make technology feel more human.
Iâ€™m passionate about teaching machines to do the math for me, so I can focus on the creative parts. ðŸ˜„
